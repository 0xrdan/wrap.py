# WrapPy

WrapPy is a simple Python script executor developed by [Dan Monteiro](https://github.com/0xrDan). It provides a user-friendly interface to load, execute, and display the output of Python scripts.

## Features
- Load Python scripts into the editor.
- Syntax highlighting for Python code.
- Execute loaded Python code and view output.
- Supports updating and executing code on-the-fly.

## Usage
1. **Load Script**: Click on the "Load File" button to select a Python script (*.py) from your filesystem. The script will be loaded into the text editor.
2. **Syntax Highlighting**: The script area automatically applies syntax highlighting to your code. You can also manually highlight syntax by modifying the code or clicking on any area of the script.
3. **Execute Code**: Once your script is loaded, click on the "Execute Code" button to run the Python code. The output will be displayed in the output area below.
4. **View Output**: The output of the executed code, including any print statements, will be shown in the output area.

## Notes
- Ensure your Python environment is correctly set up to execute the loaded scripts.
- Any errors encountered during script execution will be displayed in the output area.
